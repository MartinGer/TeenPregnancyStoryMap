          We want to have a look on pregnant teenage girls of the age of 15 to 19 whereby those normally haven’t completed their core education—secondary school—have few or no marketable skills, are financially dependent upon her parents and/or continue to live at home. Often they are no mentally mature enough to raise a child on their own, which leads to problems for the mother as well as for the child.

          According to a nscl report only roughly 40 percent of teen mothers finish their high school degree. Fewer than 2 percent finish college by age 30. 
          Young woman who give birth while attending community college are 65 percent less likely to complete their degree than woman who do not have children during that time.

          Direct financial issues:
          Teenage parents face a lot of problems from parenting to finances, especially because the teenagers hasn’t even started earning when the baby is born. In the states teenage mothers face a lot of issues when it comes to financially supporting medical care. If the mother has insurance only her medical problems are covered because the baby would need a seperate insurance. Child care and purchasing of baby accessories might not seem like a problem initially, but it adds up sooner or later. Accessories include wet wipes, diapers, ointments, bottles, etc. It is required to at least be able to take care of minimum wage, which is obviously difficult for a mother, who does little or no work to manage.

These young mothers are not able to fully develop a sense of self-identity because of their role as an expecting mother. Further, peer and social relationships are strained or even terminated and teen years are essentially for developing relationships with others and discovering oneself.
